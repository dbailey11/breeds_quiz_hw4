## About

- As a student in University of Denver's coding bootcamp, it is imperative that we will be prepared to be given some sort of coding assessment that will test our knowledge of all things programming. This applicaiton was to put our skills and knowledge to the test to have us implement HTML, CSS, and Javascript together to build a functioning multiple choice quiz.
- The application emphasizes the use of Javascript to render quesitons and choices as well as a score percent at the end. The user has 10 seconds per each question before they are automatically taken to the next question. At the end of the quiz the user will receive a message with their quiz percentage.
- This application is available to download and work on via source files or GitHub pages.

## Installation

- Will need a code editing software to download and work on the code.
